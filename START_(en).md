## Get started

You can use this starter as the base for a new Next.js project.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Guto-Edu/nextjs-brazilian-starter.git
```

Enter the project folder:

```bash
cd nextjs-brazilian-starter
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Choose only one package manager for the project. If you use npm, keep `package-lock.json`. If you use pnpm, keep `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with the variables required by your project.

Not every variable is required to run the initial starter. Configure only what your chosen stack needs.

### 4. Run the development server

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open the app in your browser:

```txt
http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Start adapting the project

Once the project is running, the recommended first steps are:

1. Rename the project in `package.json`.
2. Update the title, description, favicon and metadata.
3. Replace public page texts, links and visual identity.
4. Configure the selected database in `src/lib/database`.
5. Adjust or remove examples that will not be used.
6. Create the real domains of the project, such as customers, products, orders, billing or users.
7. Review the files inside the `docs` folder to understand providers, contexts, formatters, components and database structure.

From this point, the base is ready to evolve into a dashboard, SaaS, internal system, admin portal or MVP with authentication and CRUDs.
